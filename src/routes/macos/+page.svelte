		<h1 class="mb-8">MacOS Power User Setup</h1>

		<p>
			I've setup my mac so that it is as fast to navigate through and work on as Linux. The main
			things I did this with are:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/" target="_blank">karabiner elements</a>
				(breakdown <a href="/karabiner">here</a>)
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.raycast.com/" target="_blank">raycast</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://rectangleapp.com/" target="_blank">rectangle</a>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Starting with the simplest one, rectangle is just my window manager. I really only ever use
			the binding
			<code>left_option + left_control + enter</code> for full-screening and centering a window.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong
				>The key to all of this is never ever use the desktops or built in full screen of macos.
				This will massively slow down your jumping between apps, just fullscreen them and jump
				around with <code>cmd + tab</code> and the raycast opening shortcuts.</strong
			>
		</p>

		<p>
			The next key piece is karabiner elements. I use this to make a <strong>hyper key</strong> on
			caps lock. I have it bound so that if you tap it, it presses escape, and if you press it with
			something else it acts as <code>control + option + shift + command</code>. This is insanely
			powerful for navigation and work, especially when combined with raycast.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have raycast bound to <code>hyper + space</code> (which is really
			<code>caps lock + space</code>). Then in raycast if you search extensions, then search for an
			application, then you can set a keybinding for it. Mine are all hyper + something. You can see
			them all <a href="/karabiner">here</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Super Easy Configs</h2>

		<p>
			When I setup my mac I did a ton of custom stuff for tmux, ghostty, and cursor. I never read
			any of the configs for any of them, I just ended up making little commands for opencode, then
			had an AI write them for me. They're not complex, but if you want mine for a reference:
		</p>

		<h3>ghostty</h3>
		<p><code>~/.opencode/command/ghostty.md</code></p>

		<div class="relative">
			<button
				class="bg-accent text-background absolute right-2 top-2 flex items-center gap-1 rounded px-2 py-1 text-xs font-semibold transition-opacity hover:opacity-80"
				onclick={() => copyToClipboard(ghosttyContent)}
			>
				<Copy size={12} />
				Copy
			</button>
